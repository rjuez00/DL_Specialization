# DL_Specialization
I'm auditing the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng. by my own and doing the assigments in my own computer.

THIS SOLUTIONS MAY BE WRONG, I HAVEN'T TESTED THEM IN THE AUTOGRADER OF COURSERA.
When I have more time I'll buy coursera subscription and deliver everything.
Nevertheless the notebooks come with the expected results and the forums are open for people who audit the course too, if you want to try them by yourself you have the notebooks without solutions in my github.
